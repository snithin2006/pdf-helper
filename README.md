# PDF Helper

PDF Helper is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload PDF files, extract text from them, and ask questions about the content. The system uses the SentenceTransformer for embedding, a local vector database (ChromaDB) for managing document embeddings, and the Groq API for generating answers.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload and process PDF files.
- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from uploaded PDFs and chunk it into manageable segments.
- **Text Embedding**: Use SentenceTransformer to generate embeddings for the text chunks.
- **Question Answering**: Query the processed document and get answers using a language model via Groq API.
